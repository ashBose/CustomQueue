QA/Automation Instructions:

1. We're looking for the ability to find the bugs in the queues code that was implemented here per the instructions in the README.md.
2. Please create a test harness that catches the bugs in the existing solution and tests for all the cases that are possible.  You can use existing open-source Java tools to instrument your testing.
3. Please create an additional file named: FRAMEWORK.md in the root directory that describes the different things that aren't implementable in the .rar file but can be done to improve the quality of this code.
4. Feel free to test outside the specification if you believe you have a resonable implied or arguable requirement, just please explain it briefly if you do.
5. Bonus if you create a .patch file with patches to fix the existing bugs.
