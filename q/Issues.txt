Priority  Issue
High      The _hash implementation is creating null pointer exception
High      The sequence implementation is Wrong, it is casting double to integer
Low       We assume the string to be json, if we pass any other type except Json it throws Json Parse
          Exception, which is confusing, A QadiumException will be thrown for better understanding
High      private variable which are mentioned as _fieldname does not work expected
High      Transformation logic is used for all Json message, it should check it after private variables
Medium    System does not handle the nested json properly, if a nested json contains "Qadium" it will not work
